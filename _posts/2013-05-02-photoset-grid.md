The photoset option is up there as one of our favorite features on Tumblr, but the default photoset grid that Tumblr generates does not resize and play well with all of our [Style Hatch](http://stylehatch.co/) theme’s responsive layouts. As a result we created our own resizable photoset grid jQuery plugin that we rolled out last year.

We recently took the time to clean up the plugin, write documentation, and put together a demo showing how it works. The [jQuery photoset grid plugin](http://stylehatch.github.com/photoset-grid/) can be integrated into Tumblr themes, but it’s designed to work outside of Tumblr as well.

Feel free to [open issues, fork it, and submit pull requests](https://github.com/stylehatch/photoset-grid/)!
